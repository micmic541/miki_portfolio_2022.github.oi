# Welcome!
This is Miki's portfolio that I've been working on since 2022.

From this portfolio, you can get to know me and know the skill and tools I usually use for making webpages. And you can also see my previous works. 

There is contact info below on the page if you'd like to reach out to me!
Excited to hear from you :)

# Progress as of Jul, 2023
The portfolio is almost done, however, I'm currently trying to fix some more things.
For example, I need to still adjust "contact" section on the bottom, fix the animation for header menu.
And hopefully I'd also like to take better picture of myself and do photoshop.
